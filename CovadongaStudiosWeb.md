For the duration of this semester, as Covadonga Studios, a group of first years in Videogame Design and Development, we'll be doing our best efforts to recreate the Neo-Geo game, Shock Troopers, created in 1997, leading to a series of 6 titles. The game was originally developed by Saurus and published by SNK. When it came out for the Neo-Geo arcade and home platform, it snuck into the top 15 of most-successful arcade game of the month, becoming quite popular in no time.

Shock Troopers is an eight way shooter "run and gun" that offers a lot of gameplay options considering the year it was released on. The original game had a bunch of characters and two gamemodes with 3 paths. We are foccusing on Milky, going through the first level of the jungle route in "Lonely Wolf". The gameplay itself is pretty intuitive, containing eight way movement and shooting and our main goal being killing enemies and going forward to the end of the level while dodging bullets and putting our abilities, like rolls or grenades, to the best use possible.

 As we can see in our roles, compared to the start of the semester, we had to adapt to the game and its requirements. Having so much animations, enemies and particles, we had to organize and distribute the job to fit our project and optimize the time we had to our best capabilities.
 Daniel and Ivo, initially stated as Manager and QA, spent most of their time ripping sprites and organizing the spritesheet to facilitate the coder's job. Even though it may not sound as a huge responsability, with one quick look to our SpriteSheet, we can see the hard work they went through and the wonderful job they've done. Pau, intially stated as coder, was the backbone of our group, coding and implementing tons of animations the others were sending in, while making the game playable and not so horrible-looking. Sergi, initially stated as artist, once the Pre-Alpha was submitted, didn't have much to do, that's why he moved to doing all the PushBacks and implementing some animations to facilitete the coder's work. Noel, initially stated as Designer, did all the research so our project could develop smoothly and took care of the UI, one of the most important things, basically because you can see it all the time.
