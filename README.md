Short description:

Speaking about the game itself, it's an eight way shooter "run and gun" that offers a lot of gameplay options considering the year it was released on. The player will be able to choose how to approach every level, either "Team Battle" or "Lonely Wolf". The gameplay itself is pretty intuitive, containing eight way movement and shooting and our main goal being killing enemies and going forward to the end of the level while dodging bullets and putting our abilities, like rolls or grenades, to the best use possible.

HOW TO PLAY:

The game is about advancing through a jungle killing enemies by shooting, stabing and thrownig bombs.

the controls are:
W - move upwards
A - move to the left
S - move downwards
D - move to the right
SPACE - shooting/stabing

For the duration of this semester, as Covadonga Studios, a group of first years in Videogame Design and Development, we'll be doing our best efforts to recreate the Neo-Geo game, Shock Troopers, created in 1997, leading to a series of 6 titles. The game was originally developed by Saurus and published by SNK. When it came out for the Neo-Geo arcade and home platform, it snuck into the top 15 of most-successful arcade game of the month, becoming quite popular in no time.

Shock Troopers is an eight way shooter "run and gun" that offers a lot of gameplay options considering the year it was released on. The original game had a bunch of characters and two gamemodes with 3 paths. We are foccusing on Milky, going through the first level of the jungle route in "Lonely Wolf". The gameplay itself is pretty intuitive, containing eight way movement and shooting and our main goal being killing enemies and going forward to the end of the level while dodging bullets and putting our abilities, like rolls or grenades, to the best use possible.
