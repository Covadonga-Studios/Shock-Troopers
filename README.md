Short description:

Speaking about the game itself, it's an eight way shooter "run and gun" that offers a lot of gameplay options considering the year it was released on. The player will be able to choose how to approach every level, either "Team Battle" or "Lonely Wolf". The gameplay itself is pretty intuitive, containing eight way movement and shooting and our main goal being killing enemies and going forward to the end of the level while dodging bullets and putting our abilities, like rolls or grenades, to the best use possible.
